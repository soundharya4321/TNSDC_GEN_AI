# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

This repository contains the code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

## Overview

The CNN model is designed for image classification tasks. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction, and fully connected layers for classification.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture is as follows:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Three convolutional layers with 32, 64, and 128 filters respectively, each followed by batch normalization and max-pooling layers.

2. **Flatten Layer**: Flattens the output of the convolutional layers into a one-dimensional vector.

3. **Dense Layers**: Two dense (fully connected) layers with 128 and 64 neurons respectively, followed by dropout layers with a dropout rate of 0.1 to prevent overfitting.

4. **Output Layer**: Output layer with one neuron and sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Model Training

The model is trained using the following configurations:

- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Dropout Rate: 0.1

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of images with shape (256, 256, 3). Make sure to preprocess your dataset accordingly before training the model.

## Usage

To train the model, run the training script and provide the necessary dataset. You may need to adjust hyperparameters and model architecture based on your specific problem and dataset.

Example usage:

```bash
python train.py --dataset path_to_dataset
To evaluate the trained model on a separate test set, use the evaluation script:
python evaluate.py --model path_to_saved_model --test_data path_to_test_data
